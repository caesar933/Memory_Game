# Game engine

The game was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The DOM was manipulated using Vanilla JS framework. It sctructure is as it follows:
  1. A deck of cards was created and it shuffles every time the user starts a new game
  2. I created a timer, a counter for the moves made during the game and star rating system which starts from 3 stars and drops a star after a number of moves was made.
  3. A popup modal was also created which appears after the users finish the game and displays the number of moves made, the time spent and the star rating. 
  4. I added effects, such as animation and fading to the game using CSS.
